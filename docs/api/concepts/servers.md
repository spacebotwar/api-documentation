Different functions, for example **User Administration** or **Chat** are
managed on different Web Socket servers.

Some heavily used functions (such as **Chat**) may be allocated several servers
depending upon demand.

Currently there is only one server for each of the following functions.

* **User Administration** - registration, logging in, user settings.
* **Chat** - real-time chat system
* **Game** - general game mechanics
* **Arena** - real-time views on individual battles
